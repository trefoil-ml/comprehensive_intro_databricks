Data Lake Storage Gen2 is the result of converging the capabilities of Microsoft's two existing storage services, Azure Blob storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1. Features from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1, such as file system semantics, directory, and file level security and scale are combined with the low-cost, tiered storage, and high availability/disaster recovery capabilities from Azure Blob storage.\n\n> **Note**: Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 is in Public Preview.\n\nADLS Gen2 makes Azure Storage the foundation for building enterprise data lakes on Azure. Designed from the start to service multiple petabytes of information while sustaining hundreds of gigabits of throughput, ADLS Gen2 allows you to easily manage massive amounts of data.\n\nThis lesson illustrates how to provision an ADLS Gen2 instance and use the [Azure Blob File Stystem (ABFS) driver](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-abfs-driver) built into the Databricks Runtime to query data stored in ADLS Gen2.\n\n## Prerequisites\n* An Azure Databricks cluster running Databricks Runtime 5.1 or above. Azure Databricks integration with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 is **fully supported in Databricks Runtime 5.1**. You can use Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 with Databricks Runtime 4.2 to 5.0, however support is limited and we strongly recommend that you upgrade your clusters to 5.1.\n* **IMPORTANT**: To complete the OAuth 2.0 access components of this module you must:\n  * Have a cluster running Databricks Runtime 5.1 and above.\n  * Have permissions within your Azure subscription to create an App Registration and service principal within Azure Active Directory.\n* Lesson: <a href=\"$./06-Data-Lakes\">Querying Data Lakes with DataFrames</a>","commandVersion":0,"state":"error","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":0,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"","latestUserId":null,"commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"39f78ca9-1708-468e-9b37-e2950eee8332"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":1745794912676118,"guid":"0cbae568-ec1f-4e0b-8311-06492de699ea","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":2.875,"command":"%md\n### Getting Started\n\nRun the following cell to configure our \"classroom.\"","commandVersion":0,"state":"error","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":0,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"","latestUserId":"4258953226069350","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"a9e52204-465c-4ec3-bc98-eb87b5e0fda6"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":1745794912676119,"guid":"49cfa441-058f-4ebe-a62d-ddd7b8f9c281","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":2.9375,"command":"%run \"./Includes/Classroom-Setup\"","commandVersion":0,"state":"error","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":1547068171950,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"kyle@solliance.net","latestUserId":"4258953226069350","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"8ae2a1fb-acbd-4f17-81f3-52e1ee803127"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":1745794912676120,"guid":"00780990-8de0-4d82-874b-ba5269c77b4a","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":3.0,"command":"%md\n## Create Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2)\n\nTo get started, you first need to provision an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account in Azure.\n\n1.

The hierarchical namespace organizes objects/files into a hierarchy of directories for efficient data access. A common object store naming convention uses slashes in the name to mimic a hierarchical directory structure. This structure becomes real with ADLS Gen2. Operations such as renaming or deleting a directory become single atomic metadata operations on the directory rather than enumerating and processing all objects that share the name prefix of the directory.\n\n> **Important**: When the hierarchical namespace is enabled, Azure Blob Storage APIs are not available, which means you cannot use the `wasb` or `wasbs` scheme to access the `blob.core.windows.net` endpoint.\n\nBefore you can access the hierarchical namespace in your ADLS Gen2 account, you must initialize a file system. To accomplish this, run the cell below, which will create a file system named `demo`.

Often files are added to a Data Lake by different groups at different times.  While each file itself usually has clean data, there is little consistency across files.  The advantage of this strategy is that anyone can contribute information to the Data Lake and that Data Lakes scale to store arbitrarily large and diverse data.  The tradeoff for this ease in storing data is that it doesn’t have the rigid structure of a more traditional relational data model so the person querying the Data Lake will need to clean the data before extracting useful insights.\n\nThe alternative to a Data Lake is a Data Warehouse.  In a Data Warehouse, a committee often regulates the schema and ensures data is cleaned before being made available.  This makes querying much easier but also makes gathering the data much more expensive and time-consuming.  Many companies choose to start with a Data Lake to accumulate data.  Then, as the need arises, they clean the data and produce higher quality tables for querying.  This reduces the upfront costs while still making data easier to query over time.  These cleaned tables can even be later loaded into a formal data warehouse through nightly batch jobs.  In this way, Apache Spark can be used to manage and query both Data Lakes and Data Warehouses.","commandVersion":0,"state":"error","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":0,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"","latestUserId":"4258953226069350","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"2c3e2683-706f-45c8-9971-ba7e06ed99be"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":1745794912676150,"guid":"3d56dd3f-a666-4653-ac7a-617d06c8d814","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":14.0,"command":"%sql\n\nSELECT
