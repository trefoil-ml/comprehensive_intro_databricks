Data scientists often wish to extract insights from this data.\n\nThe classic approach to querying this data is to load it into a central database called a **data warehouse**. Traditionally, data engineers must design the schema for the central database, extract the data from the various data sources, transform the data to fit the warehouse schema, and load it into the central database. A data scientist can then query the data warehouse directly or query smaller data sets created to optimize specific types of queries. The data warehouse approach works well, but requires a great deal of up front effort to design and populate schemas. It also limits historical data, which is constrained to only the data that fits the warehouse’s schema.\n\nAn alternative approach is a **Data Lake**, which:\n\n* Is a storage repository that cheaply stores a vast amount of raw data in its native format.\n* Consists of current and historical data dumps in various formats including XML, JSON, CSV, Parquet, etc.\n* May contain operational relational databases with live transactional data.\n\nSpark is ideal for querying Data Lakes. Spark DataFrames can be used to read directly from raw files contained in a Data Lake and then execute queries to join and aggregate the data.\n\nThis lesson illustrates how to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights from a Data Lake.\n\n## Prerequisites\n* **IMPORTANT**: You must have permissions within your Azure subscription to create an App Registration and service principal within Azure Active Directory to complete this lesson.\n* Lesson: <a href=\"$./02-Querying-Files\">Querying Files with SQL</a>","commandVersion":0,"state":"error","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":0,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"","latestUserId":null,"commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"4957a66f-e1ed-44e2-a0f9-db283a805580"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":1745794912676569,"guid":"c6b841d6-1632-48b1-929e-1bf5e3866b62","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":4.0,"command":"%md\n### Getting Started\n\nRun the following cell to configure our \"classroom.\"","commandVersion":0,"state":"error","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":0,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"","latestUserId":"4258953226069350","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"b0c07f87-0510-49b6-a78c-82f6d3076e88"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":1745794912676570,"guid":"48bbe477-8fd8-45c9-8acc-b3dce310c1fb","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":5.0,"command":"%run \"./Includes/Classroom-Setup\"","commandVersion":0,"state":"error","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":0,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"","latestUserId":"4258953226069350","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"3317655b-69ce-42d2-b833-aeed8b110e12"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":1745794912676571,"guid":"13a2e486-31f0-4956-9db5-366b4bc4a938","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":5.5,"command":"%md\n## Create Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 (ADLS)\n\n1.

Often files are added to a Data Lake by different groups at different times.  While each file itself usually has clean data, there is little consistency across files.  The advantage of this strategy is that anyone can contribute information to the Data Lake and that Data Lakes scale to store arbitrarily large and diverse data.  The tradeoff for this ease in storing data is that it doesn’t have the rigid structure of a more traditional relational data model so the person querying the Data Lake will need to clean the data before extracting useful insights.\n\nThe alternative to a Data Lake is a Data Warehouse.  In a Data Warehouse, a committee often regulates the schema and ensures data is cleaned before being made available.  This makes querying much easier but also makes gathering the data much more expensive and time-consuming.  Many companies choose to start with a Data Lake to accumulate data.  Then, as the need arises, they clean the data and produce higher quality tables for querying.  This reduces the upfront costs while still making data easier to query over time.  These cleaned tables can even be later loaded into a formal data warehouse through nightly batch jobs.  In this way, Apache Spark can be used to manage and query both Data Lakes and Data Warehouses.","commandVersion":0,"state":"error","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":0,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"","latestUserId":"4258953226069350","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"3921cbf3-c69f-4ac1-aaf1-62112a8947b0"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":1745794912676588,"guid":"fad14bf5-6b41-4e35-a291-4633714dab56","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":14.0,"command":"%sql\n\nSELECT

Review Questions\n**Q:** What is a Data Lake?  \n**A:** Data Lakes are a loose collection of data files gathered from various sources.  Spark loads each file as a table and then executes queries joining and aggregating these files.\n\n**Q:** What are some advantages of Data Lakes over more classic Data Warehouses?  \n**A:** Data Lakes allow for large amounts of data to be aggregated from many sources with minimal ceremony or overhead.  Data Lakes also allow for very very large files.  Powerful query engines such as Spark can read the diverse collection of files and execute complex queries efficiently.\n\n**Q:** What are some advantages of Data Warehouses?  \n**A:** Data warehouses are neatly curated to ensure data from all sources fit a common schema.  This makes them very easy to query.\n\n**Q:** What's the best way to combine the advantages of Data Lakes and Data Warehouses?  \n**A:** Start with a Data Lake.  As you query, you will discover cases where the data needs to be cleaned, combined, and made more accessible.  Create periodic Spark jobs to read these raw sources and write new \"golden\" tables that are cleaned and more easily queried.","commandVersion":0,"state":"error","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":0,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"","latestUserId":"4258953226069350","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"d260bd9e-ca01-4c5f-90b7-d7d5d88a64fa"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":1745794912676621,"guid":"b16fafb3-7b63-4116-ad6f-9f10d92d66f5","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":47.0,"command":"%md\n## Next Steps\n* Continue to the [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2]($./07-Azure-Data-Lake-Gen2) lesson","commandVersion":0,"state":"error","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":0,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"","latestUserId":"4258953226069350","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"0fc4fe52-9e54-48d9-8182-708bd0585ba8"}],"dashboards":[],"guid":"c3e86c45-0488-4270-9f2f-078a611ff986","globalVars":{},"iPythonMetadata":null,"inputWidgets":{}}
