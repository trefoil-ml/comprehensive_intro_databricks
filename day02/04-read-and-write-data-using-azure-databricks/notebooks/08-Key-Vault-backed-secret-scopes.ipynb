These secret scopes allow you to store secrets, such as database connection strings, securely. If someone tries to output a secret to a notebook, it is replaced by `[REDACTED]`. This helps prevent someone from viewing the secret or accidentally leaking it when displaying or sharing the notebook.\n\nIn this lesson, you will learn how to configure a Key Vault-backed secret scope. You will use Key Vault to store sensitive connection information for Azure SQL Database and Azure Cosmos DB. This notebook walks you through the required steps to create the Key Vault, Azure SQL Database, and Cosmos DB resources, and how to create a Key Vault-backed secret scope."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Setup\n\nTo begin, you will need to create the required resources in the Azure portal.
