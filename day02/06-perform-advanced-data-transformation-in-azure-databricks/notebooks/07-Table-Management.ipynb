In this case, a `DROP TABLE` command removes both the metadata for the table as well as the data itself.  \n\n**Unmanaged tables** manage the metadata from a table such as the schema and data location, but the data itself sits in a different location, often backed by a blob store like the Azure Blob Storage. Dropping an unmanaged table drops only the metadata associated with the table while the data itself remains in place.\n\n<div><img src=\"https://files.training.databricks.com/images/eLearning/ETL-Part-2/managed-and-unmanaged-tables.png\" style=\"height: 400px; margin: 20px\"/></div>"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Writing to a Managed Table\n\nManaged tables allow access to data using the Spark SQL API."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Run the cell below to mount the data."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%run \"./Includes/Classroom-Setup\""],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":5},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Create a DataFrame."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df = spark.range(1, 100)\n\ndisplay(df)"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":7},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Register the table."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.write.mode(\"OVERWRITE\").saveAsTable(\"myTableManaged\")"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":9},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Use `DESCRIBE EXTENDED` to describe the contents of the table.
