If you are new to Python and/or Data Science this will be plenty of content to digest.   \nBut if you have more experience you might have time to explore the advanced section as well. This section contains many interesting things that we won't explain to the same level of detail as the main part."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["This lab is structured into three notebooks that cover the most important topics related to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
