These secret scopes allow you to store secrets, such as database connection strings, securely. If someone tries to output a secret to a notebook, it is replaced by `[REDACTED]`. This helps prevent someone from viewing the secret or accidentally leaking it when displaying or sharing the notebook.\n\nIn this lesson, you will learn how to configure a Key Vault-backed secret scope. You will use Key Vault to store sensitive connection information for Azure SQL Database and Azure Cosmos DB. This notebook walks you through the required steps to create the Key Vault, Azure SQL Database, and Cosmos DB resources, and how to create a Key Vault-backed secret scope.","commandVersion":0,"state":"error","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":0,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"","latestUserId":"4258953226069350","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"9b1b7825-f7c6-42b9-a2b1-83a980ed0632"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":1745794912674669,"guid":"fc5ec828-2a0f-44eb-99b4-6bd6adbdf8de","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":1.5,"command":"%md\n\n## Setup\n\nTo begin, you will need to create the required resources in the Azure portal.

Enter the name of the secret scope, such as `key-vault-secrets`.\n3. Select **Creator** within the Manage Principal drop-down to specify only the creator (which is you) of the secret scope has the MANAGE permission.\n\n  > MANAGE permission allows users to read and write to this secret scope, and, in the case of accounts on the Azure Databricks Premium Plan, to change permissions for the scope.\n\n  > Your account must have the Azure Databricks Premium Plan for you to be able to select Creator. This is the recommended approach: grant MANAGE permission to the Creator when you create the secret scope, and then assign more granular access permissions after you have tested the scope.\n\n4. Enter the **DNS Name** (for example, https://databricks-demo.vault.azure.net/) and **Resource ID** you copied earlier during the Key Vault creation step, for example: `/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/azure-databricks/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/Databricks-Demo`.
