Data Lake Storage Gen2 is the result of converging the capabilities of Microsoft's two existing storage services, Azure Blob storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1. Features from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1, such as file system semantics, directory, and file level security and scale are combined with the low-cost, tiered storage, and high availability/disaster recovery capabilities from Azure Blob storage.\n\n> **Note**: Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 is in Public Preview.\n\nADLS Gen2 makes Azure Storage the foundation for building enterprise data lakes on Azure. Designed from the start to service multiple petabytes of information while sustaining hundreds of gigabits of throughput, ADLS Gen2 allows you to easily manage massive amounts of data.\n\nThis lesson illustrates how to provision an ADLS Gen2 instance and use the [Azure Blob File Stystem (ABFS) driver](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-abfs-driver) built into the Databricks Runtime to query data stored in ADLS Gen2.\n\n## Prerequisites\n* An Azure Databricks cluster running Databricks Runtime 5.1 or above. Azure Databricks integration with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 is **fully supported in Databricks Runtime 5.1**. You can use Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 with Databricks Runtime 4.2 to 5.0, however support is limited and we strongly recommend that you upgrade your clusters to 5.1.\n* **IMPORTANT**: To complete the OAuth 2.0 access components of this module you must:\n  * Have a cluster running Databricks Runtime 5.1 and above.\n  * Have permissions within your Azure subscription to create an App Registration and service principal within Azure Active Directory.\n* Lesson: <a href=\"$./06-Data-Lakes\">Querying Data Lakes with DataFrames</a>","commandVersion":0,"state":"error","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":0,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"","latestUserId":null,"commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"c0d50959-1fb3-4593-b3b3-d93f0c5c5a18"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":1745794912674886,"guid":"cfa13615-c3f5-49c0-bd2c-ff3600912aef","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":1.5,"command":"%md\n### Getting Started\n\nRun the following cell to configure our \"classroom.\"","commandVersion":0,"state":"error","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":0,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"","latestUserId":"4258953226069350","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"99ee797b-0d8b-42e9-91d4-2eed36190cee"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":1745794912674887,"guid":"1209986e-3ad3-47ac-a741-9c7c3244ac5d","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":2.0,"command":"%run \"./Includes/Classroom-Setup\"","commandVersion":0,"state":"error","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":1547067174037,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"kyle@solliance.net","latestUserId":"4258953226069350","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"024b8f6e-1b54-4e2e-9a86-cf5fabffebff"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":1745794912674888,"guid":"99cefec7-c16c-4e93-8a9b-3c296fc628f5","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":3.0,"command":"%md\n## Create Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2)\n\nTo get started, you first need to provision an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account in Azure.\n\n1.

The hierarchical namespace organizes objects/files into a hierarchy of directories for efficient data access. A common object store naming convention uses slashes in the name to mimic a hierarchical directory structure. This structure becomes real with ADLS Gen2. Operations such as renaming or deleting a directory become single atomic metadata operations on the directory rather than enumerating and processing all objects that share the name prefix of the directory.\n\n> **Important**: When the hierarchical namespace is enabled, Azure Blob Storage APIs are not available, which means you cannot use the `wasb` or `wasbs` scheme to access the `blob.core.windows.net` endpoint.\n\nBefore you can access the hierarchical namespace in your ADLS Gen2 account, you must initialize a file system. To accomplish this, run the cell below, which will create a file system named `demo`.

the two DataFrames created, it is now possible to review the first couple records of each file.\n\nNotice in the example below:\n* The `crimeDataNewYorkDF` and `crimeDataBostonDF` DataFrames use different names for the columns.\n* The data itself is formatted differently and different names are used for similar concepts.\n\nThis is common in a Data Lake. Often files are added to a Data Lake by different groups at different times. The advantage of this strategy is that anyone can contribute information to the Data Lake and that Data Lakes scale to store arbitrarily large and diverse data. The tradeoff for this ease in storing data is that it doesn’t have the rigid structure of a traditional relational data model, so the person querying the Data Lake will need to normalize data before extracting useful insights.\n\nThe alternative to a Data Lake is a data warehouse.  In a data warehouse, a committee often regulates the schema and ensures data is normalized before being made available.  This makes querying much easier but also makes gathering the data much more expensive and time-consuming.  Many companies choose to start with a Data Lake to accumulate data.  Then, as the need arises, they normalize data and produce higher quality tables for querying.  This reduces the up front costs while still making data easier to query over time.  The normalized tables can later be loaded into a formal data warehouse through nightly batch jobs.  In this way, Apache Spark is used to manage and query both Data Lakes and data warehouses.","commandVersion":0,"state":"error","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":0,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"","latestUserId":"4258953226069350","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"1c5ec5b9-4ee1-4543-9877-10ad3ba15fde"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":1745794912674917,"guid":"829ea329-9a61-4e96-96dc-0c25c9b0ec30","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":25.0,"command":"display(crimeDataNewYorkDF)","commandVersion":0,"state":"error","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":1547067102195,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"kyle@solliance.net","latestUserId":"4258953226069350","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"2d53526f-0086-4e1d-b38a-c1fb3eb286fe"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":1745794912674918,"guid":"060f160d-1b8b-4e51-9d10-a739e26c1e18","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":26.0,"command":"display(crimeDataBostonDF)","commandVersion":0,"state":"error","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":1547067107233,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"kyle@solliance.net","latestUserId":"4258953226069350","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"d4d9b96d-a902-4586-9ee0-6287b5476737"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":1745794912674919,"guid":"bc744873-2dc7-4290-8181-01390562d8ff","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":27.0,"command":"%md\n##

`reportDate` timestamp data type.\n* `lower()` to convert text to lowercase.\n* `contains(mySubstr)` to indicate a string contains substring `mySubstr`.\n\nAlso, note we use `||`  to indicate a
