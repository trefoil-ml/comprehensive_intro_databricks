Data scientists often wish to extract insights from this data.\n\nThe classic approach to querying this data is to load it into a central database called a **data warehouse**. Traditionally, data engineers must design the schema for the central database, extract the data from the various data sources, transform the data to fit the warehouse schema, and load it into the central database. A data scientist can then query the data warehouse directly or query smaller data sets created to optimize specific types of queries. The data warehouse approach works well, but requires a great deal of up front effort to design and populate schemas. It also limits historical data, which is constrained to only the data that fits the warehouseâ€™s schema.\n\nAn alternative approach is a **Data Lake**, which:\n\n* Is a storage repository that cheaply stores a vast amount of raw data in its native format.\n* Consists of current and historical data dumps in various formats including XML, JSON, CSV, Parquet, etc.\n* May contain operational relational databases with live transactional data.\n\nSpark is ideal for querying Data Lakes. Spark DataFrames can be used to read directly from raw files contained in a Data Lake and then execute queries to join and aggregate the data.\n\nThis lesson illustrates how to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights from a Data Lake.\n\n## Prerequisites\n* **IMPORTANT**: You must have permissions within your Azure subscription to create an App Registration and service principal within Azure Active Directory to complete this lesson.\n* Lesson: <a href=\"$./02-Querying-Files\">Querying Files with SQL</a>"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Getting Started\n\nRun the following cell to configure our \"classroom.\""],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%run \"./Includes/Classroom-Setup\""],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Create Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 (ADLS)\n\n1.

Often files are added to a Data Lake by different groups at different times. The advantage of this strategy is that anyone can contribute information to the Data Lake and that Data Lakes scale to store arbitrarily large and diverse data. The tradeoff for this ease in storing data is that it doesnâ€™t have the rigid structure of a traditional relational data model, so the person querying the Data Lake will need to normalize data before extracting useful insights.\n\nThe alternative to a Data Lake is a data warehouse.  In a data warehouse, a committee often regulates the schema and ensures data is normalized before being made available.  This makes querying much easier but also makes gathering the data much more expensive and time-consuming.  Many companies choose to start with a Data Lake to accumulate data.  Then, as the need arises, they normalize data and produce higher quality tables for querying.  This reduces the up front costs while still making data easier to query over time.  The normalized tables can later be loaded into a formal data warehouse through nightly batch jobs.

Data Lakes also allow for very large files.  Powerful query engines such as Spark can read the diverse collection of files and execute complex queries efficiently.\n\n**Q:** What are some advantages of Data Warehouses?  \n**A:** Data warehouses are neatly curated to ensure data from all sources fit a common schema.  This makes them easy to query.\n\n**Q:** What's the best way to combine the advantages of Data Lakes and Data Warehouses?  \n**A:** Start with a Data Lake.  As you query, you will discover cases where the data needs to be cleaned, combined, and made more accessible.
